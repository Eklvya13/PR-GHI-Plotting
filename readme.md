# Project Title: Data Processing and Visualization

## How to Run

### Setup
1. **Dataset Placement**: 
   - Place the extracted dataset folder named `Data` in the same directory as `main.py`.
   - Ensure that the structure is preserved, and the dataset is properly organized as expected by the script.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure to install the required libraries before running the script. You can do this using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - The `requirements.txt` file should include all necessary dependencies, such as:
     ```txt
     numpy
     pandas
     matplotlib
     ```

### Running the Script
1. Execute the script by running `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
    ```
2. Script Process:
     - The script will preprocess the dataset, clean it, and generate a combined.csv file containing the cleaned data.
     - It will also create a plot showing the data visualization.

### Output
1. Generated Files:
    - combined.csv: This file contains the preprocessed and cleaned data from the dataset.
    - plot_daterange.jpeg: A JPEG image of the plot generated from the processed data, showing various trends based on the provided data.
### Additional Files
1. PreprocessedData.csv: A sample of the preprocessed data, which can be used to validate or compare results.
2. SampleDatasetPlot.jpeg: An example of a plot image generated by the script for a sample dataset.

### Notes
* The preprocessing includes handling missing data, normalization, and formatting to ensure consistency across the dataset.
* The plot generated includes visual markers and trends, such as scatter points, 30-day moving averages, and a budget line.
* You can modify the script to handle different ranges or adjust the visualization to your needs.

### Future Improvements
* Implement interactive plots with libraries like Plotly.
* Add more sophisticated data processing methods or support for different data formats.
